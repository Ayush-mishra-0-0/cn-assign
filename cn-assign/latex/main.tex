\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=purple!5!white, colframe=purple!75!black, fonttitle=\bfseries, title=TCP CUBIC Overview]
\subsection{{Algorithm Details}}
TCP CUBIC uses a cubic growth function to handle congestion, optimizing for high-bandwidth delay product (BDP) networks.

\subsubsection*{Mathematical Model}
The cubic growth function is:
\begin{equation}
W(t) = C(t-K)^3 + W_{max}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $W(t)$: Window size at time $t$
    \item $C$: Scaling factor (default 0.4)
    \item $K = \sqrt[3]{\frac{W_{max}\beta}{C}}$: Time offset, with $\beta$ as the multiplicative decrease factor
    \item $W_{max}$: Window size just before last congestion
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/tcp_cubic.png}
\end{center}

\subsection{{Growth Phases and State Transitions}}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
    \item \textbf{Concave Region} ($t < K$): Slow initial growth for stability.
    \item \textbf{Convex Region} ($t > K$): Aggressive growth for bandwidth probing.
    \item \textbf{Plateau Region} ($t \approx K$): Stabilizes near $W_{max}$, ideal for steady-state.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=purple!5!white, colframe=purple!75!black, fonttitle=\bfseries, title=TCP CUBIC Overview]
\subsection{{Key Features and Limitations}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strengths}: High throughput in high-speed networks, good RTT fairness.
    \item \textbf{Limitations}: RTT fairness issues in mixed RTT networks, limited handling of random loss.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{{Application Scenarios}}
Ideal for long-distance high-speed networks, data centers, cloud computing, and large data transfers.

\subsection{TCP Vegas Algorithm Details}
\begin{tcolorbox}[
    enhanced,
    colback=white,
    colframe=blue!75!black,
    title=Algorithm Implementation Details]

\subsubsection{Core Mechanism}
TCP Vegas implements a delay-based congestion control mechanism that operates through:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{RTT Monitoring}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tracks BaseRTT (minimum observed RTT)
        \item Measures CurrentRTT for each packet
        \item Calculates expected and actual throughput
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Mathematical Foundation}
    \begin{equation}
        R_{expected} = \frac{WindowSize}{BaseRTT}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        R_{actual} = \frac{WindowSize}{CurrentRTT}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        diff = (R_{expected} - R_{actual}) \times BaseRTT
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Window Adjustment Logic}
    \begin{equation}
        WindowSize = 
        \begin{cases}
            WindowSize + 1, & \text{if } diff < \alpha \\
            WindowSize - 1, & \text{if } diff > \beta \\
            WindowSize, & \text{if } \alpha \leq diff \leq \beta
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Implementation Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Threshold Parameters}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\alpha$: Lower threshold (typically 2-3 packets)
        \item $\beta$: Upper threshold (typically 4-6 packets)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{RTT Calculation}:
    \begin{equation}
        Queue_{estimated} = \left(1 - \frac{BaseRTT}{CurrentRTT}\right) \times WindowSize
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Congestion Window Update}:
    \[
    \Delta WindowSize = 
    \begin{cases}
        +1/WindowSize & \text{if queue < } \alpha \\
        -1/WindowSize & \text{if queue > } \beta \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{tcolorbox}[
    enhanced,
    colback=white,
    colframe=blue!75!black,
    title=Algorithm Phases]
    
\subsubsection{Algorithm Phases}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Slow Start Phase}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Increases window exponentially until first congestion detection
        \item Transitions to congestion avoidance when diff > threshold
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Congestion Avoidance Phase}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Maintains optimal window size based on RTT measurements
        \item Adjusts window using the difference equation
    \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Retransmission Phase}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Retransmits lost packets detected through timeouts or duplicate acknowledgments.
    \item Uses the estimated RTT for calculating timeouts more accurately than in traditional TCP variants.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Timeout Phase}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resets the congestion window to a small value (typically one or two segments) after a timeout event.
    \item Enters the Slow Start Phase again, adapting quickly to network conditions.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

% Algorithm Section: TCP Veno
\section{\textcolor{sectioncolor}{TCP Veno (Hybrid)}}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=boxbg, colframe=boxborder, title=TCP Veno Overview]
\subsection{{Algorithm Details}}
TCP Veno combines the congestion detection of Vegas with the loss response of NewReno.

\subsubsection*{Mathematical Model}
Backlogged packets ($N$) is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
N = (R_{expected} - R_{actual}) \times BaseRTT
\end{equation}

State determination and window adjustment:
\[
\text{State} = 
\begin{cases}
\text{Non-congested}, & \text{if } N < \beta \\
\text{Congested}, & \text{if } N \geq \beta
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection{\textcolor{textColor}{Key Features and Limitations}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strengths}: Combines proactive delay-based control with loss-based response.
    \item \textbf{Limitations}: Compromises in both fairness and throughput.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{Application Scenarios}}
Useful in wireless networks where packet loss can be frequent, as it combines robustness with fairness.

% Algorithm Section: TCP NewReno
\section{\textcolor{sectioncolor}{TCP NewReno (Loss-based)}}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=boxbg, colframe=boxborder, title=TCP NewReno Overview]
\subsection{{Algorithm Details}}
TCP NewReno refines the loss recovery phase of TCP Reno, particularly for fast recovery.

\subsubsection*{Mathematical Model}
During Congestion Avoidance:
\begin{equation}
cwnd = 
\begin{cases}
cwnd + \frac{MSS^2}{cwnd}, & \text{per RTT} \\
cwnd \times (1 - \beta), & \text{on packet loss}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $cwnd$ is the congestion window, $MSS$ is the maximum segment size, and $\beta \approx 0.5$.

% \end{center}

\textbf{Observations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Slow Start}: The initial phase shows an exponential growth in the congestion window, as the algorithm probes the network capacity.
    \item \textbf{Congestion Avoidance}: After reaching the congestion threshold, the window size grows linearly, reducing the risk of congestion.
    \item \textbf{Packet Loss}: On packet loss, the window size is reduced by a multiplicative factor, leading to a temporary decrease in throughput.
    \item \textbf{Stability}: The algorithm maintains a balance between aggressive probing and stability, adapting to network conditions.
    \item \textbf{RTT Unfairness}: NewReno may exhibit RTT unfairness in mixed RTT networks due to its loss-based approach.
    \item \textbf{Predictable Behavior}: The algorithm's response to packet loss is predictable and well-suited for wired networks.
\end{itemize}

Different phases of TCP NewReno's congestion control mechanism can be identified from the graph:

        \end{enumerate}
    }
    \item Packet Loss and Recovery: {
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Multiplicative decrease in $cwnd$ on packet loss to prevent congestion.

    Q2. Find the average throughput for each of the congestion control algorithms using tshark
    from the pcap files generated, and state which algorithm performed the best.
\end{tcolorbox}

\Large{\textbf{Solution:}}\\
To calculate the average throughput for each congestion control algorithm using tshark from the pcap files generated, I created a bash file to automate the process which is:-
% two images side by side
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{images/throughput_calculation1.jpg}
\end{center}
Here i made a function \textbf{calculate\_throughput} which takes the pcap file as input and calculates the average throughput using tshark.\\
The throughput is calculated by filtering the relevant packets and extracting the data size and duration of the transfer.\\
The average throughput is then calculated by dividing the total data size by the total transfer duration.
The command used for this is : 

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=boxbg, colframe=boxborder, title=Command Used]
   \begin{verbatim}
tshark -r $1 -Y "tcp.analysis.ack_rtt and tcp.analysis.ack_rtt < 0.1" -T 
fields -e frame.len -e frame.time_delta 
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{images/throughput_calculation2.jpg}
\end{center}
The script is executed for each pcap file generated for the different congestion control algorithms, and the average throughput is calculated.
The results are then compared to determine which algorithm performed the best based on the average throughput.

After executing the script for each pcap file, the average throughput for each congestion control algorithm is as follows:
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{images/throughput_df.jpg}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=boxbg, colframe=boxborder, title=Question-2]
    Q3. How many times did the TCP algo reduce the cwnd and why?
\end{tcolorbox}

\Large{\textbf{Solution:}}\\
From the pcap files generated for each congestion control algorithm, I analyzed the number of times the TCP algorithm reduced the congestion window ($cwnd$) and the reasons behind it.\\
The reduction in $cwnd$ occurs when the TCP algorithm detects congestion in the network, typically due to packet loss or delay.\\
To detect such cases , I created a reduce\_cwnd\_analysis.py file to automate the process which is:-

\Large{\textbf{Solution:}}\\
In this section, I made a run\_throughput\_test.sh script to automate the process of changing the bandwidth and latency of the point-to-point connection and analyzing its effect on average throughput.\\

Mainly, It is done by changing the bandwidth and latency of the point-to-point connection using the tc command in Linux.\\
\begin{center}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The plot depicts the relationship between throughput, bandwidth, and latency in a network system. The x-axis represents the bandwidth (Mbps), the y-axis represents the throughput (Mbps), and the z-axis represents the latency (ms).
        \item The plot shows a 3D surface that visualizes how throughput varies as a function of bandwidth and latency. The surface has a mountain-like shape, indicating that throughput increases with higher bandwidth and lower latency.
        \item The highest throughput (around 45 Mbps) is achieved at the peak of the surface, where the bandwidth is around 30 Mbps and the latency is around 10 ms. This suggests that the system performs best under these network conditions.
        \item The plot also reveals that throughput decreases as either bandwidth or latency deviates from the optimal values. For example, as the latency increases, the throughput drops significantly, even with high bandwidth.
        \item The complex shape of the surface plot highlights the interdependence of throughput, bandwidth, and latency, and the importance of carefully balancing these factors to achieve optimal network performance.

        \item The heatmap shows that higher bandwidth and lower latency result in higher throughput, represented by the brighter yellow-to-red regions.
        \item The plot reveals an optimal bandwidth-latency sweet spot around 30-35 Mbps and 10-15 ms latency, where throughput is maximized.
        \item As bandwidth increases or latency worsens, the throughput gradually decreases, represented by the transition to cooler colors.
        \item The heatmap provides a clear visual representation of the interdependence between network parameters and their impact on overall system performance.

    \subsection{NewReno}
    \textbf{Inference:} The RTT graph for NewReno shows significant fluctuations, with sharp peaks and valleys. This indicates an aggressive and reactive congestion control mechanism.\\
    \textbf{Observation:} The large RTT variations suggest NewReno is unsuitable for networks with high bandwidth-delay products, struggling to maintain stable throughput.
    
    \subsection{HighSpeed}
    \textbf{Inference:} The RTT graph for HighSpeed displays a smoother, more controlled pattern than NewReno, indicating a more adaptive congestion control algorithm.\\
    \textbf{Observation:} This stability aligns with HighSpeed's design for high-speed networks, where sophisticated window adjustments help maintain consistent performance.
    
    \subsection{Vegas}
    \textbf{Inference:} Vegas exhibits a stable RTT throughout the observation, with few spikes, reflecting its proactive congestion avoidance.\\
    \textbf{Observation:} The smooth RTT pattern indicates Vegas's effectiveness in maintaining performance through RTT-based congestion control, adjusting the window to avoid fluctuations.
    
    \subsection{Veno}
    \textbf{Inference:} Veno's RTT plot shows smooth segments interspersed with spikes, suggesting a balanced congestion control approach.\\
    \textbf{Observation:} Veno effectively differentiates congestion-related losses from random losses, leading to a balanced RTT pattern, suitable for mixed wired and wireless networks.


\section{PART-B}
\begin{verbatim}
a. You need to create a new CCA named Tcp<first_name> and you need to try 
to improve TcpNewReno’s performance. 

b. You need to focus only on the SlowStart phase and in order to improve it 
you need to replace Reno’s slow start with TCP Hystart (whose implementation
can be found in src/internet/model/tcp-cubic.cc which is ns-3’s Tcp Cubic 
implementation).

c. You aim and try to make the slow start phase more intelligent with better 
exit points by doing this (more about Hystart at Reference a) but once you 
have done this you need to evaluate your algorithm’s performance, so consider
the dumbbell topology in demo.cc, make all the flows TCP and evaluate the 
standard metrics like throughput, congestion window, ssthresh, rtt variation 
qbetween your algo and NewReno.
\end{verbatim}

\large{\textbf{Solution:}}\\
For this part, I will create a new congestion control algorithm named TcpAyush, focusing on improving the Slow Start phase by replacing Reno's slow start with TCP Hystart.\\
All the class and variables are defined in the tcp-ayush.h and functions in tcp-ayush.cc files.\\
Following are the main sections of the code in tcpayush.h :-
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{images/tcpayush.h.jpg}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{images/tcpayush-functions.jpg}
\end{center}
In this project, I improved the \texttt{TcpAyush} congestion control algorithm by referencing the \textcolor{blue}{TCP Cubic} implementation in \texttt{ns-3}, particularly integrating \textcolor{teal}{Hystart's} intelligent slow-start mechanism. The focus was on making the slow-start phase more adaptive by incorporating \textcolor{purple}{dynamic exit points}, as recommended in the reference material.

The primary enhancements included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adding Hystart-inspired \textcolor{red}{adaptive exit criteria} for the slow-start phase.
    \item Adjusting \textcolor{purple}{thresholds} within the slow-start mechanism to better respond to \textcolor{orange}{real-time network conditions}.
\end{itemize}

To evaluate performance, I tested \texttt{TcpAyush} using the \textcolor{blue}{dumbbell topology} in \texttt{demo.cc}, which allows for a clear comparison of \textcolor{teal}{throughput results}. Several modifications were necessary in \texttt{demo.cc} to properly accommodate and benchmark \texttt{TcpAyush}, ensuring reliable and meaningful performance metrics.

With these adjustments in place, the next step will involve running \textcolor{purple}{simulations} to analyze the throughput results.

    \caption{Throughput file for tcpayush}
\end{center}

\end{center}

\begin{verbatim}
d. Also, calculate the value of Jain’s fairness index (more 
about this at Reference b) by varying the number of flows
as 4,8,16,20. So in the first run of your experiment all 
the flows will be using TcpNewReno so that becomes your 
baseline readings for comparison and in the second run of 
experiment, half of the flows will be using TcpNewReno while
the other half of the flows will be using your new CCA. 
Create a table like shown below and populate it with the 
fairness values achieved in each case.
\end{verbatim}

For this, I created a bash file \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{jain-index.sh}} to calculate the \textcolor{teal}{Jain's fairness index} by varying the \textcolor{purple}{number of flows} and comparing the performance of \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{TcpNewReno}} with \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{TcpAyush}}. 

There are two main tasks: first, to create \textcolor{orange}{4 files} for mixed flows, and then \textcolor{orange}{4} for NewReno flows. For this task, I created \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{create-file.sh}} to automate the process of generating files for both \textcolor{teal}{mixed} and \textcolor{teal}{NewReno} flows.

This looks like:

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{images/create-sh.jpg}
    \caption{Code to create file and save it in scratch directory}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{images/create-sh2.jpg}
    \caption{Taking input for flows and creating new file with this flow value.}
\end{center}

Second task is to calculate the Jain's fairness index for each case and populate the table \\
with the fairness values achieved in each case.\\

f. Finally, try to justify and explain the results of the comparison thus obtained.
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{\textcolor{teal}{RTT (Round Trip Time) Comparison:}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Both algorithms show similar \textcolor{purple}{RTT} patterns over time, with values fluctuating between approximately \textcolor{orange}{0.005} and \textcolor{orange}{0.035 seconds}.
    \item The \textcolor{purple}{RTT} fluctuations are highly correlated between both algorithms.
    \item Neither algorithm consistently maintains a lower \textcolor{purple}{RTT} than the other, suggesting \textcolor{teal}{similar delay characteristics}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{teal}{Average TCP Throughput:}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Ayush} achieves slightly higher throughput (\textcolor{purple}{0.85 Mbps}) compared to \texttt{NewReno} (\textcolor{purple}{0.75 Mbps}).
    \item This represents approximately a \textcolor{teal}{13\% throughput improvement} with \texttt{Ayush}.
    \item The higher throughput may indicate more efficient \textcolor{purple}{bandwidth utilization} by \texttt{Ayush}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{teal}{Slow Start Threshold Evolution:}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean values: \texttt{Ayush} (\textcolor{purple}{3257.23 bytes}) vs \texttt{NewReno} (\textcolor{purple}{3181.32 bytes}).
    \item Both algorithms exhibit similar patterns of \textcolor{teal}{threshold adjustments}.
    \item \texttt{Ayush} maintains a slightly higher average threshold, allowing more \textcolor{purple}{aggressive sending behavior}.
    \item This higher threshold in \texttt{Ayush} may explain its \textcolor{teal}{better throughput}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{teal}{Congestion Window Evolution:}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean values: \texttt{Ayush} (\textcolor{purple}{7544.21 bytes}) vs \texttt{NewReno} (\textcolor{purple}{7491.34 bytes}).
    \item Both algorithms display similar patterns in \textcolor{teal}{window size adjustments}.
    \item \texttt{Ayush} maintains a marginally larger average window size.
    \item The window size variations in \texttt{Ayush} are more pronounced, suggesting \textcolor{purple}{more dynamic adjustments} to network conditions.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{teal}{Justification of Results:}}

\textbf{Improved Performance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Ayush}'s improved throughput can be attributed to its slightly higher average \textcolor{teal}{congestion window} and \textcolor{teal}{slow-start threshold}.
    \item The algorithm appears to be more aggressive in \textcolor{purple}{utilizing available bandwidth} while maintaining similar \textcolor{purple}{RTT characteristics}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Stability:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Despite its more aggressive behavior, \texttt{Ayush} maintains \textcolor{purple}{RTT values} comparable to \texttt{NewReno}.
    \item This suggests that the improved throughput does not lead to increased \textcolor{purple}{network congestion}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Adaptability:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The more dynamic congestion window adjustments in \texttt{Ayush} indicate better \textcolor{teal}{responsiveness to network conditions}.
    \item This adaptability likely contributes to its ability to maintain higher throughput while keeping \textcolor{purple}{RTT} within a reasonable range.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Trade-offs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The minor differences in mean values suggest that \texttt{Ayush} achieves subtle yet effective improvements over \texttt{NewReno}.
    \item The similar \textcolor{purple}{RTT patterns} indicate that the throughput gains do not compromise \textcolor{teal}{network stability}.
\end{itemize}
